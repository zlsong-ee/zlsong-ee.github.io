I'm currently a Master student in Mechanical Engineering (ME) at [Ocean College](http://oc.zju.edu.cn/global/main.htm), [Zhejiang University (ZJU)](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) since 2022 under the supervision of [Prof. Haocai Huang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/bluedream).

I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Mechanical Engineering (ME) from [Shandong University of Science and Technology (SDUST)](https://en.sdust.edu.cn/) in 2022.

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
